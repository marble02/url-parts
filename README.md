# url-parts

This is a project to help with parsing of url parts.

To use:
1. This project is deployed at https://marble02.github.io/url-parts/ with github pages.
2. At the top of the page, you can enter a url you want to parse, and a table will appear right below your entry with the various parts.
3. If your url had elements that could be decoded, a decoded variation will appear in that part's value cell too, alongside the original non-decoded part.
4. At the very bottom, there is also a reference with code snippets of methods you can use to parse url in some different languages (currently JavaScript, Java, Python).
